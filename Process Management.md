## 1. Explain the concept of process creation in operating systems. 
- A process is a program in execution.
- A new process is created by an existing process -> parent creates child.
- The first process in UNIX/Linux is init (PID = 1).
- Parent process starts execution from main().
- Child process starts execution from the point where fork() is called.
- fork() is executed twice: once in parent, once in the child.
- Return values of fork() :
  - 0 -> returned to the child process.
  - Child PID -> returned to the parent process.
- After creation, the child may call exec() to load and run a new program.
- Parent may either continue execution in parallel or wait for the child to terminate.
- OS maintains a Process Control Block (PCB) for each process to track its state, resources, and execution context.
